# SyntaxError: (irb):2: syntax error, unexpected ')', expecting '}'
#    from /usr/local/rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-rc2/bin/irb:16:in `<main>'

# Answer:
# It shows syntax error! Requires changing the ')' into '}' in order to make it work.
# It could be a hash data that needs to be close properly with the "}" instead of ")".
