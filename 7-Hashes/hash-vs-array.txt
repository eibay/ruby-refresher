HASHES VS. ARRAYS

Does this data need to be associated with a specific label? If yes, use a hash. If the data doesn't have a natural label, then typically an array will work fine.

Does order matter? If yes, then use an array. As of Ruby 1.9, hashes also maintain order, but usually ordered items are stored in an array.

Do I need a "stack" or a "queue" structure? Arrays are good at mimicking simple "first-in-first-out" queues, or "last-in-first-out" stacks.
