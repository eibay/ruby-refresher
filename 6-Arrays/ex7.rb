# Write a program that iterates over an array and builds a new array 
# that is the result of incrementing each value in the original array 
# by a value of 2. You should have two arrays at the end of this program, 
# The original array and the new array you've created.
# Print both arrays to the screen using the p method instead of puts.

# ANSWER
array1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
array2 = []

array2 = array1.map { |e| e + 2  }

p array1
p array2

# SOLUTION
# arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# new_arr = []

# arr.each do |n|
#   new_arr << n + 2
# end

# p arr
# p new_arr
